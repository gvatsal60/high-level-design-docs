Welcome to the **High-Level Design Docs** repository.
This is a collection of high-level design (HLD) documentation for software architecture,
system design, and other related topics. The purpose of this repository is to provide a
structured, comprehensive view of architectural decisions, patterns, and system overviews
to guide developers, engineers, and architects in building scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems.

## Overview

This repository contains design documentation for various system components, services,
and architecture decisions, with a focus on high-level design. These documents help visualize
and communicate the structure and flow of complex systems, aiding teams in understanding
the overall architecture before diving into implementation.

## Purpose

The goal of the **High-Level Design Docs** repository is to:

- Provide a centralized place for all high-level architectural decisions and design documentation.
- Standardize the format for presenting high-level designs and system overviews.
- Serve as a reference for both new and existing projects to ensure consistency in design patterns and principles.
- Facilitate collaboration between architects, engineers, and stakeholders.
